Getting help
************

Here are the main sources of help with QuPath questions:

* This documentation, including :doc:`../reference/faqs`

* `forum.image.sc <https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath>`_ - **main user forum**, shared with other open source projects

* `Issues on GitHub <https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues>`_ - bug-reports, *not* general questions

* `YouTube channel <http://youtube.com/c/qupath>`_ - includes **video tutorials** (still mostly for v0.1.2)

* `Pete's blog <https://petebankhead.github.io/>`_ - especially useful for opinions, plans & scripting info

* `Twitter <https://twitter.com/QuPath>`_ - most things will be **announced here first**

.. tip::
  There's also a fantastic forum post introducing QuPath from a user's perspective `here <https://forum.image.sc/t/qupath-intro-choose-your-own-analysis-adventure/27906>`_.

If your needs for instruction are more modest, it's always worthwhile to try hovering your mouse over nearby buttons or input controls - there's a good chance that an explanation will popup to explain what the control does.
